<h2>A RIPPLE OF DISSENSION AND WHAT CAME OF IT.</h2>


<p>I was about to be married. My numerous
charms and attractions had won the affections
of a young man who was equally charming with
myself.</p>

<p>We were sitting on a luxurious divan and
he held my milk-white hand in his. I do not
make that statement as a startling announcement
of an unusual occurrence, but simply as a
matter of fact.</p>

<p>We had been conversing about the culinary
and domestic arrangements of our future home
when matrimony had made us "one flesh;" or,
to use English, we had been wondering what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
under the canopy a good cooking stove would
cost, when he asked suddenly and irrelevantly,</p>

<p>"And you will love me, always?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said I, a little impatiently; for
when one is deep in a mathematical problem
such a question is a little annoying.</p>

<p>"And you will honor me always?" he next
inquired.</p>

<p>"As long as you deserve to be honored,"
I replied, with the habitual good sense of my
age and sex, mentally wondering if granite-ware
stewpans went with a cooking stove.</p>

<p>"And you will obey me?" he queried next,
in a tone that plainly indicated that I'd have to.
I left the mathematical problem for future solution
and said, hesitatingly:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if&mdash;I&mdash;can."</p>

<p>"If you can?" he said, in sternly questioning
tones; and a cloud no bigger than a man's hand
appeared upon the heaven of our love.</p>

<p>"I don't believe a woman ever lived who
ever obeyed any one&mdash;God, angels, or men," I
cried.</p>

<p>"You are a traitor. You slander your sex,"
he exclaimed, aghast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p><p>"I deny the charge," I replied, springing to
my feet, with all the spirit of the above-mentioned
age and sex. "By that assertion I only
add glory to their fame." He looked at me for
a little while, too surprised to speak, and then
said, in sarcastic tones:</p>

<p>"Consider our wedding postponed until you
have had a little time to study your Bible.
Good night."</p>

<p>"'Study your Bible!' That is what everybody
says when they want to prove any theory,
creed, ism, or anything. I shall study my Bible
diligently. Good night," I replied, thinking
it was not such very bad advice after all; and
then I hummed a gay little tune for his benefit
until I heard the hall door close.</p>

<p>And I have studied my Bible with the following
result.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_EVE" id="THE_STORY_OF_EVE"></a>THE STORY OF EVE.</h2>


<p>Away back when Adam was a young man&mdash;now
I know that Adam is rather an ancient
subject, but you need not elevate your eyebrows
in scorn, for you will be ancient yourself
sometime&mdash;he found himself in Eden one day;
he did not know why, but we do, don't we?</p>

<p>He was there because Eve was to come, and
it was a foregone conclusion even in that early
age that when she did appear she would want
some one to hold her bouquet, open the door
for her, button her gloves, tell her she was
pretty and sweet and "I never saw a woman
like you before," you know.</p>

<p>Her arrival was the greatest event the world
has ever known, and the grandest preparations
were made for it.</p>

<p>A blue sky arched gloriously over the earth,
and sun, moon and stars flashed and circled
into space, silvery rivers ran cool and slow
through scented valleys, the trees threw cooling
shadows on the fresh, damp grass, the birds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
sang in the rosy dawn, the flowers blushed in
odorous silence and yet it was all incomplete,
and Adam wandered restlessly around like a
man who has lost his collar button.</p>

<p>But suddenly a great hush of expectancy
fell upon the world. Not a bird fluttered its
feathers, the flowers bowed their heads, the
winds and the waters listening ceased their
flowing and their blowing, the radiant moonshine
mingled its light with the pale pink dawn
and a million stars paled their eternal fires, as
Eve, the first woman, stood in Eden.</p>

<p>And the world was young and beautiful.
The first flush and bloom was on the mountains
and the valleys, the birds were thrilled by the
sweetness of their own songs, the waves broke
into little murmurs of delight at their own
liquid beauty, the stars of heaven and the
unfading blue were above Adam's head&mdash;and
yet he wasn't satisfied. Long he stood idly in
the brightening dawn wondering why the days
were so long and why there were so many of
them, when suddenly out from the swinging
vines and the swaying foliage Eve came forth.</p>

<p>And though there was a vacant look on her
lovely face (for her baby soul had not yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
awakened) Adam saw that her lips were red
and her arm white and rounded and he whistled
a soft, low whistle with a sort of "O-won't-you-stop-a-moment?"
cadence in the music, and
Eve looked up; and I think at that moment he
plucked a flower and offered it to her; and of
course she did not understand it all, but Nature,
not intelligence, asserted her power, and she
reached out her hand and took the rose&mdash;and
then for the first time in the world a woman
blushed and smiled; and I suspect it was at that
very moment that "the morning stars first sang
together."</p>

<p>Woman has never been obedient. She has
always had the germ of the ruler and autocrat
in her soul. It was born when Eve first looked
with longing eyes at the apple swinging in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>While Adam was idly, lazily sunning himself
in the garden was Eve contented to smell the
fragrance of the violets and bask in the starlight
of a new world? Oh no! She was
quietly wandering around searching for the
Serpent, and when she found him she smiled
upon him and he thought the world grew
brighter; then she laughed and his subjugation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
was complete; and then the naughty creature,
without waiting for an introduction, led him to
the famous apple tree, and standing on her tip-toes,
reached up her hands and said with a soul-subduing
little pout:</p>

<p>"See, I want that apple, but I can't reach it.
Won't you please find a club and knock it off
for me?" and she looked out of the corner of
her eye and blushed divinely.</p>

<p>Now this Serpent represented, so it has always
been believed, a very shrewd person. He
saw that this woman had no garments, and that
after she had eaten this fruit she would know
better, and delight in clothes ever after. So he
gave her the apple.</p>

<p>Almost instantly after she had eaten some,
not because she particularly liked apples, or
had any idea of their adaptability in the way of
pies, sauce or cider, but because she wanted to
"be as gods knowing good and evil," as the
Serpent said she would. Discontent with her
wardrobe crept into her heart and ambition for
something better sprang to life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Illustration_WHILE_ADAM_WAS_IDLY_LAZILY_SUNNING_HIMSELF" id="Illustration_WHILE_ADAM_WAS_IDLY_LAZILY_SUNNING_HIMSELF"></a>
<img src="images/image025.jpg" width="600" height="375" alt="&quot;WHILE ADAM WAS IDLY, LAZILY SUNNING HIMSELF IN THE GARDEN.&quot;"
title="WHILE ADAM WAS IDLY, LAZILY SUNNING HIMSELF IN THE GARDEN." />
<span class="caption">&quot;WHILE ADAM WAS IDLY, LAZILY SUNNING HIMSELF IN THE GARDEN.&quot;</span>
</p>

<p>In the distance stood Adam. With a thrill
of rapture she beheld him, her aroused soul
flashed from her eyes and love was born, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
she ran toward him through the flowers, pausing
on the river's brink to rest, for weariness
had touched her limbs.</p>

<p>She watched the waters running south out
of the garden, and like one coming out of a
dim, sweet twilight into a blaze of glory she
looked and wondered "why" it ran that way,
and lo! Thought blossomed like a rose, and
generosity laughed in the sunshine when she
put the apple in Adam's hand; and Adam, with
the only woman in the world beside him, and
the first free lunch before him, forgot all about
God and His commands and "did eat," and the
results prove that free lunches always did demoralize
men&mdash;and always will. And modesty
blushed rosy red when Adam put the apple to
his lips, and invention and ingenuity, new-born,
rushed to the rescue, and they gathered
the fig leaves.</p>

<p>Then memory like a demon whispered in
her ear: "The day that ye eat thereof ye shall
surely die." She glanced at Adam and deadly
fear chilled the joyous blood in her veins.
Then she argued: "He will be less angry with
me, a woman, and His vengeance will fall less
heavily on me than on the man to whom His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
command was given;" and lo! Reason rose like
a star on the waves of life, and shoulder to
shoulder womanly devotion and heroism that
fears neither God nor death in defense of its
loved ones entered her soul, and she instructed
Adam to say: "The woman tempted me," and
deception trembled on her lips when she cried:
"The serpent did tempt me," and the tears of
regret and remorse watered the seeds of deception
and they grew so luxuriously that women
have always had that same way of getting out
of scrapes ever since.</p>

<p>Yet to Eve belongs the honor of never
having obeyed any one&mdash;when it interfered
with progress, advancement and intelligence&mdash;neither
God, angels nor men.</p>

<p>The women of the nineteenth century make
a profound salaam of admiration and respect
to Eve, in whom they recognize the first courageous,
undaunted pioneer woman of the world.</p>

for "he was very rich in cattle, in silver and in
gold." So, as provisions grew short in Canaan,
and as in those days when men went on a
pleasure trip they took their wives with them,
Sarah accompanied him to Egypt.</p>

<p>Up to this time husbands had only been
obedient, but in this age they began to be complimentary,
and as Sarah and Abraham were
about entering Egypt, he said to her, "Behold
now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look
upon," and even if it is the first compliment on
record, we must admit, even at this late day,
that Abraham was far advanced in the art of
flattery.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p><p>Now Sarah was the pioneer, champion,
incomparable coquette of the ancient world,
and as such deserves our earnest attention.</p>

<p>We gather from the following events that
Abraham realized her unequaled proclivities
for getting in with kings, landlords and other
magnates of the countries through which she
was pleasuring, and so he told her to pass herself
off as his sister; and because she believed
it would enhance her chances of having a good
time, and as it was easy, natural and agreeable,
she did it, and not because she had any idea of
merely obeying her husband.</p>

<p>Abraham wanted their marriage kept secret
because, in those days, when a lover-king
wished to get rid of an obnoxious husband, he
hypnotized him into eternal silence by having
him used as a target for a sling, a spear or
javelin, instead of causing an appeal to the
divorce courts, as they do in this civilized and
enlightened generation. And I believe that,
after all, the old way is the better one, for
when men and women die, they are dead, but
when they are only divorced they are awfully
alive sometimes.</p>

</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p><p>And it came to pass, when they arrived in
Egypt, the Egyptians "beheld the woman that
she was very fair," and the men watched on the
street corners to see her go by; and she passed
herself as a giddy maiden with such unrivaled
success that she gained a notoriety that would
have made the fortune of a modern actress, and
the princes of Pharaoh commended her wit,
beauty and grace to the king, "and the woman
was taken into Pharaoh's house."</p>

<p>The attentive reader will observe that Holy
Writ, in speaking of a woman, never deigns to
say that she is virtuous, industrious, obedient,
or a good cook, but seems to ignore everything
but the fact that "she was fair to look upon."</p>

<p>That was all that seemed to be required of
the "holy women of old."</p>

<p>And Pharaoh "entreated Abraham well for
Sarah's sake" (you notice they did everything
to please the ladies in those days), and loaded
him with riches, presents and honors; and
Pharaoh's wives and sub-wives and cadet wives
didn't like it. And the Secretary of the Treasury,
the Prime Minister and the High Lord
Chamberlain of the Bedchamber didn't like it.
The neighbors began to talk openly; the scandal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
"smelled to heaven;" and the Lord Himself
had to interfere to head the fair Sarah off, and
He "plagued Pharaoh and his house with great
plagues, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife."</p>

<p>And then&mdash;after the preliminary amorous
clasping of hands, the little caressing attentions,
the lingering kisses; after the fiery
expectation and the rapture of possession, after
all this came&mdash;as it always does&mdash;the tragedy
of satiety and separation.</p>

<p>"And Abraham went up out of Egypt, he,
and his wife and all that he had."</p>

</p>

<p>Yet Peter, in speaking of the duties of wives,
has the temerity to refer to the "holy women
of old," and holds Sarah up as a bright and
shining example for us to follow, saying, "even
as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord."
But we won't lay this up against Peter, for it is a
telling fact (and shows the predicament he was
in) that he had to go back nearly two thousand
years to find an obedient woman. There were
evidently none in his day, but as he wished to
make his teaching effective and submit some
proof to clinch his argument, he went back to
Sarah and said, "even as Sarah obeyed Abraham,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
which shows he had never gotten at the
real facts in the lovely Sarah's career, or else
was misrepresenting Sarah to carry his point in
favor of the men.</p>


<p>A careful perusal of my Bible convinces me
that the "holy women of old," as Peter dubs
them, were all afflicted with a chronic determination
to have their own way&mdash;and they had it.</p>

<p>But the men were always obedient to the
women, and each one "hearkened unto the
voice of his wife" and also obeyed God and the
angels.</p>

<p>At this point in the history of the affable
Sarah and the dutiful Abraham we come to the
Abraham-Hagar case, and find the hired-girl
question already agitating society.</p>

<p>And the historian tells us that Sarah told
Abraham that he could have Hagar for his very
own, and then the narrator naively remarks,
"And Abraham hearkened unto the voice of
his wife."</p>

<p>But of course this is a vile slander against
Sarah, and, at this late day, I rise to refute the
charge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p><p>Probably some of Abraham's political friends,
when the disgrace broke forth in all its rosy
glory, trumped up this story about Sarah's consent
to save his reputation. But Sarah never
did anything of the kind, as her subsequent
actions prove. It isn't human nature; it isn't
wifely nature; and although Sarah was a little
gay-hearted herself, she wasn't going to stand
any such nonsense&mdash;to speak lightly&mdash;from
Abraham, and when she discovered his intimacy
with the hired girl she quietly called him into
the tent, and in less than ten seconds she made
his life a howling wilderness. I don't know
exactly what she said (as I wasn't there), but
it ended, as such scenes usually do end, by
the dear man repenting. For, since he is found
out, what else can a man do? He said he was
sorely tempted, no doubt, and so forth and so
on to the end of the chapter, and said: "Thy
maid is in thy hands; do unto her as it pleaseth
thee." And "Sarah dealt hardly with her, and
she fled from her face." But she came back,
because you remember she met an angel in the
wilderness, and he told her to return. Nice
advice from an angel, wasn't it?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<p class="figleft" style="width: 274px;">
<a name="Abraham_entertaining_the_three_angels." id="Abraham_entertaining_the_three_angels."></a>
<img src="images/image041.jpg" width="274" height="400" alt="(Abraham entertaining the three angels.)" title="Abraham entertaining the three angels." />
</p>

<p>The next scene
in which the
lovely Sarah
distinguishes
herself, and nobly sustains
her record for
disobedience and a determination
to follow the dictates
of her own sweet will, was
when Abraham entertained the
three angels.</p>

<p>Now hobnobbing with angels wasn't
an every-day affair, even in that age
when angels were more plentiful than
they are now.</p>

<p>And Abraham was naturally a little
excited, and he "hastened into the tent unto
Sarah," and said: "Make ready quickly three
measures of fine meal, knead it, and make
cakes upon the hearth;" and he gave orders to
a young man to kill a calf, etc. And after a
while the supper was served, with all the delicacies
the rich and great could afford, and
everything appeared that he had ordered&mdash;except
Sarah's cakes. They were simply and
inexplicably <i>non est</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p><p>Of course it was a pretty shabby thing for a
woman to go back on her husband in his hour
of need, and when there were angels in the
house too; but she did it, thereby sustaining
her reputation for crookedness and general
contrariness as a wife.</p>

<p>And yet it has always been preached to us
that we should obey our husbands "even as
Sarah obeyed Abraham." Well, we're willing,
since all she had to do was to look pretty, be
agreeable, and do exactly as she pleased.</p>

<p>But the very fact that Sarah has been held
up as an example for us to follow proves that
the men had not read up her record intelligently,
or else in their extremity they were
presuming on our ignorance while trying to
enforce order and submission.</p>

<p>But that was not the worst of it. When she
heard the angel tell Abraham that she should
have a son she ridiculed the idea.</p>

<p>She had the germ of the infidel in her heart,
and lacked Abraham's credulity, and would not
believe anything, even if an angel did say so,
unless it was backed up by reason and common
sense, and so she laughed behind their backs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p><p>Now it appears that angels object to being
ridiculed as well as other folk, and when they
heard her giggling they demanded to know
the reason of Abraham. It was exceedingly
naughty for her to place her husband in such a
predicament, and when she
found she was getting the
whole family into an uproar
she denied the
charge, which shows
that to her other charming and wifely qualities
she added the art of equivocating.</p>

</p>

<p>After that Abraham "sojourned in Gerar,"
and again the seductive Sarah charmed the
great king, and again the Lord had to interfere
and settle the affair.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p><p>When Isaac was born Sarah was more exacting
and jealous than ever of Hagar, and said
to Abraham: "Cast out this bond-woman and
her son; for the son of this bond-woman shall
not be heir with my son."</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<a name="And_Abraham_went_down_to_Egypt" id="And_Abraham_went_down_to_Egypt"></a>
<img src="images/image044.jpg" width="550" height="278" alt="(And Abraham went down to Egypt.)" title="And Abraham went down to Egypt." />
</p>

<p>"And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's
sight," but he "hearkened unto the voice
of his wife," like the dutiful and obedient husband
he was, and he sent Hagar and Ishmael
out into the wilderness. And even to this day
the women who are guilty of Hagar's crime are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
remorselessly sent out into the wilderness of
desertion, despair and disgrace&mdash;and it is right
and just!</p>

<p>We are told that "fashions change;" but
Sarah inaugurated a fashion that wives have
followed to this day, and will follow till the
ocean of eternity shall sweep the island of
Time into oblivion.</p>

<p>And so endeth the chapter of the second
prominent woman of "Holy Writ."</p>

<p>And Abraham was always "obedient," and
"hearkened unto the voice of his wife;" and
Sarah was a lawless, crafty, coquettish&mdash;but
never obedient woman.</p>

<h2><a name="ISAACS_WIFE" id="ISAACS_WIFE"></a>ISAAC'S WIFE.</h2>


<p>And Abraham said unto his servant, "Thou
shalt go unto my country and to my kindred,
and take a wife unto my son Isaac."</p>

<p>But the servant, who was evidently a student
of female character and knew</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That when a woman will, she will,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You may depend on it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when she won't, she won't,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And there's an end on it;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>said: "Peradventure, the woman will not be
willing to follow me unto this land."</p>

<p>Then Abraham, who was a connoisseur in
feminine ethics (as he naturally would be,
having had such able instructors as Sarah and
Hagar) and realized the utter futility of
attempting to persuade, bribe or induce a
woman to do anything she objected to doing,
said:</p>

<p>"And if the woman will not be willing to
follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this
mine oath."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p><p>So the servant departed and "went to Mesopotamia
unto the city of Nahor."</p>

<p>Now it seems in those days the girls of
Nahor went outside the city gates every evening,
according to Oriental custom, to draw
water from a well, and the artful servant of
Abraham tarried at the well at sunset, for he
knew the girls would be along presently.</p>

<p>It was a lovely eventide. The wind touched
caressingly the few dainty flowers drooping
their heads in sleepy fragrance, the birds twittered
soft words of love to their nestling mates,
the departing god of day lavished in reckless
abandon his wealth of colors; piled crimson
mountains red as his ardent love in the western
sky, and robed high heaven in golden glory
that his sweetheart&mdash;the earth&mdash;reveling in and
remembering the grandeur of his passion and
the splendor of his departure, might not love
his silver-armored rival of the night.</p>

<p>About this time the maidens tripped down
to the well, where the shrewd servant stood as
the "daughters of the men of the city came out
to draw water," and prayed:</p>

<p>"And let it come to pass that the damsel to
whom I shall say, 'Let down thy pitcher, I pray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
thee, that I may drink;' and she shall say,
'Drink,' may be the one I am looking for;" or
words to that effect.</p>

<p>The words had hardly passed his lips ere
Rebekah, with the color snatched from the
roses in her cheeks and the grace of untrammeled
freedom in her step, skipped down to
the well.</p>

<p>And Rebekah "was very fair to look upon."
Of course. In relating the history of these
examples who have been held up since time
immemorial for us to follow, the writers of
"Holy Writ" never expatiate upon their virtue,
industry, domesticity, constancy or love, but
we are simply and briefly told they were "fair
to look upon," and the natural logical inference
is that we shall "go and do likewise."</p>

<p>Belonging to one of the wealthiest and
most influential families of Nahor, of course
Rebekah's practiced eye saw at a glance that
the handsome fellow waiting at the well and
looking the girls over was a person of rank and
importance; for it is only a logical conclusion
that coming from such a master and bound
upon such an errand, he was surrounded by all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the trappings and signs of wealth and luxury
that the times afforded.</p>

<p>And the maidens of Nahor went outside the
city gates partly for the same purpose, I suppose,
as that for which the girls of other places
go to the parks and matin&eacute;es nowadays, for it
seems to have been a notorious fact that had
even spread to other countries, that the girls of
Nahor came down to the well in the blushing
sunset, and that too, without chaperon or
duenna. And I suppose the young men went
down too, to flirt with the charming damsels,
from the fact that the servant of Abraham
tarried there.</p>

<p>And Rebekah, stooping gracefully, filled her
pitcher, swung it lightly to her shoulder&mdash;and
as the woman sometimes takes the initiative in
an affair of this kind&mdash;smiled upon the willing
and ready-looking fellow; not exactly at him,
but as it were in his direction, you know; and
he caught the faint glint of sunshine on her lips,
and then&mdash;but in the witching hour when the
twilight and sunlight kiss and part, after the
smile and look of recognition everyone knows
what happens.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p><p>And he ran to her and said with the pleasing
courtesy of a man of the world:</p>

<p>"Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of
thy pitcher."</p>

<p>Then with the tact of a finished coquette, in
three little words she conveyed to him the flattering
knowledge that she recognized in him
an embassador of power, wealth and luxury,
by saying:</p>

<p>"Drink, my Lord."</p>

<p>After that they became acquainted in the
most easy, off-hand manner, without an introduction,
and yet we are told to follow the example
of these pioneers of the race who were
always "fair to look upon."</p>

<p>I never in my life heard priest or people
condemning her for forming the acquaintance of
a stranger without an introduction; she was
called one of the "mothers in Israel," and even
St. Paul, who was a regular crank about the
girls, classed her with the "holy women of
old," which proves he didn't know anything
about her history or was playing upon the
ignorance of his hearers. She was a leader of
the <i>ton</i> in Israel, and if in those days they did
not banish her from good society, why should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
we censure the same conduct when we are so
much more civilized, enlightened and liberal in
our views?</p>

<p>And in an incredibly short space of time
he adorned her with earrings and bracelets,
and she invited him home with her, and he
actually went and made it all right with her
mother and big brother by making a prepossessing
exhibition of piety, for you remember how
he told them "he bowed down his head and
worshipped the Lord."</p>

<p>He told them of Isaac, in whose name he
sued for Rebekah's fair hand. He didn't say
that Isaac was handsome, virtuous, talented or
ambitious, but he said, "the Lord hath blessed
my master and he is very great; and he hath
given him flocks and herds, and silver and
gold, and maid servants and men servants, and
camels and asses," and unto his son Isaac
"hath he given all that he hath," for this astute
man of the world seemed to know that the
surest and quickest way to win a woman was
to show her a golden pathway strewn with the
gems of power, luxury and ambition.</p>

<p>And the big brother did not pull out his
watch, look at it in a business-like way and say:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter" style="width: 506px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;LET ME, I PRAY THEE, DRINK A LITTLE WATER OF THY

</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p><p>"Rebekah, pack your trunk and be ready
to take the 6:40 fast express." And her mother
did not smile and say, "we're so delighted and
honored, I'm sure. Of course she will go."
Not at all. They knew better even in those
days than to try and coerce or coax a woman
to do anything she didn't want to do, and so
they simply said:</p>

<p>"We will call the damsel and inquire at her
mouth."</p>

<p>Then the servant brought forth jewels of
silver and jewels of gold, and raiment, and
gave them to Rebekah; and he gave also to her
brother and to her mother precious things, and
then we are naively told that Rebekah said:</p>

<p>"I will go."</p>

<p>Rebekah was a woman of decision and knew
a good thing when she saw it, and so she did
not wait to prepare a stunning trousseau or get
out wedding cards and invitations fine enough
to make all the girls of Nahor sigh in envy
and admiration, but she departed at once. Now
Isaac was of a poetical nature, and sought
the solitude of the fields at eventide to meditate.
Like most young men who have a love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
affair on hand he wanted to be alone and dream
dreams and see visions.</p>

<p>And, as good luck would have it, just at this
sentimental and opportune moment, Rebekah
hove in sight.</p>

<p>And Isaac lifted up his eyes and beheld
her; a woman with heaven in her eyes, a mouth
sweet enough to make a man forget everything
but the roses of life, and a form seductive
enough to tempt the very gods from on high.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a name="I_will_go" id="I_will_go"></a><img src="images/image058.jpg" width="450" height="372" alt="(I will go.)" title="I will go." />
</p>

<p>And she beheld a man, young
and strong and handsome,
the touch of whose hand
opened the gates of glory
to her soul, "and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
became his wife, and he loved her," thereby
putting himself on record as the first man in
the world we have any sacred official notification
of as having loved his wife.</p>

<p>So the days and months, brightened by
smiles and tarnished by tears, dropped into the
wreck-strewn, motionless
ocean of the past, and
in the course of human
events two little boys
played marbles in the tent of Isaac, and Rebekah
scored the rather doubtful distinction of going
on record as the first woman who ever doubled
expectations and presented her husband with
twins.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a name="Two_little_boys_played_marbles" id="Two_little_boys_played_marbles"></a>
<img src="images/image059.jpg" width="450" height="269" alt="(Two little boys played marbles.)" title="Two little boys played marbles." />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p><p>At this period the fair Rebekah begins to
get in her work as a disobedient wife, a deceitful,
intriguing woman and an-all-round-have-her-own-way
variety of her sex.</p>

<p>"Isaac loved Esau, but Rebekah loved
Jacob," and we conclude from that, as well as
from the actual facts in the case, that there
were domestic tornadoes, conjugal cyclones and
general unpleasantness all round. About this
time there was another famine in the land and
Isaac and Rebekah (and others) went into the
land of the Philistines to dwell, and of course
Rebekah's beauty attracted universal attention,
and the men of the place questioned Isaac
about her and he replied that she was his sister,
as he said, "lest the men of the place should
kill me for Rebekah," because she <i>was</i> fair to
look upon.</p>

<p>In that age it appears when a man fell in
love with a woman he killed her husband,
instead of hoodwinking and outwitting him as
they do in this progressive era, but I suppose
in spite of the awful chance of losing her
husband by some sudden and tragic death,
Rebekah slyly and seductively smiled upon
"the men of the place" from the fact that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
little farther on we read that the King issued a
mandate, saying:</p>

<p>"He that toucheth this man or his wife shall
surely be put to death."</p>

<p>The King knew that Isaac was favored of
the Lord, and he was afraid of some swift and
condign punishment if Isaac became offended
by the amorous attentions of any of his subjects
to Rebekah, so he gave the order to the men.</p>

<p>You will readily discern by that command
that he was a keen and intelligent student of
female character, and knew there was no use or
reason in appealing to her sense of justice, her
obedience to, or respect for law, or her regard
for the "eternal fitness of things" in a case of
the affections, and so he appealed to the fear and
obedience of the men, for he realized that no
man's pleading, no King's command, no threats
from heaven or fears of hell can stop a woman's
coquetry.</p>

<p>A little farther on Esau went the way of all
young men and married, and worse than that
he married Judith the daughter of a Hittite,
"which was a grief of mind unto Rebekah and
Isaac."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p><p>We know that one of Rebekah's strongest
points was putting herself on record for doing
something that no woman ever did before
that we have any authorized
statement of, and
she did it in this case by
being the first woman
who hated her daughter-in-law.</p>

</p>

<p>As we read on we find she was not the
meek, submissive and obedient wife we are
told women should be.</p>

<p>She systematically and continually had her
own way, in spite of husband, sons, kings, men,
God or angels.</p>

</p>

<p>We discover that by a succession of deceptions,
tricks and chicanery she cheated Esau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
out of his blessing, obtained it for Jacob, and
deceived and deluded her dying husband, all at
one fell swoop.</p>

<p>It is but just to Jacob to say that he objected
to putting himself in his brother's place, but
Rebekah said, "only obey my voice," and he
obeyed&mdash;of course.</p>

<p>The men were always obedient, as the Bible
proves conclusively. They obeyed everybody
and anybody&mdash;kings, mothers, wives, sweethearts
and courtesans.</p>

<p>But where can we find any evidence of the
vaunted obedience of woman?</p>

<p>Not among the prominent women of the
Bible at least.</p>

<p>Rebekah influenced her husband in all matters,
advanced one son's interests and balked
another's aims, prospects and ambitions. In
short she played her cards with such consummate
skill that she captured everything she
cared to take.</p>

<p>Jacob was obedient, complimentary, submissive
and loving and Rebekah was&mdash;a woman.</p>

</a><img src="images/image069.jpg" width="295" height="450" alt="(And there came two angels to Sodom.)" title="And there came two angels to Sodom." />
</p>

<p>"And there came two
angels to Sodom, at even."</p>

<p>Now Lot and his wife
were residents of Sodom,
and they entertained in the
most courteous and hospitable
manner the angels
who were the advance
guards of the destruction
that was about to sweep the
cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
into oblivion, leaving only
a blazing ash-strewn tradition to
scare the slumbers of the wicked,
and stalk a warning specter down the paths of
iniquity through unborn ages.</p>

<p>And the softening twilight fell upon the
doomed but unconscious cities. Unpitying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Nature smiled joyously. The cruel sun, possibly
knowing the secret of the angels, gayly
flaunted his myriad colors, and disappeared in
a blaze of glory without wasting one regret
upon the wicked cities he would see no more
forever.</p>

<p>No angelic hand wrote in blazing letters
one word of warning across the star-gemmed
scroll of heaven; but the song rung out on the
evening breezes, laughter rose and fell and the
red wine flowed; women danced lightly on the
brink of destruction and men jested on the
edge of the grave.</p>

<p>And yet some rumor of these angels and
their errand must have reached the fated cities,
for after Lot had dined and wined them before
they retired, "the men of the city, even the
men of Sodom, compassed the house round,
both old and young, all the people from every
quarter."</p>

<p>And Lot went out and tried to pacify them,
but his eloquence and his pleading were in
vain, and they said, "Stand back." And they
said again, "This one fellow came in to sojourn,
and he will needs be a judge."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;AND LOT WENT OUT AND TRIED TO PACIFY THEM.&quot;</span>
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p><p>And I imagine there was a great tumult and
confusion, angry words, flashing eyes and an
ominous surging to and fro, "and they pressed
sore upon the man, even Lot," but still he
pleaded the defense of the angels, and meanly
offered to bring out his two young daughters and
give to the howling mob&mdash;but the passion that
glowed in the eyes and trembled in the voices
of the raging throng was not a passion to be
allayed by the clasp of a woman's hand, the
flash of her azure eye, or the touch of her lips;
and besides, that boisterous, angry crowd evidently
did not believe in the efficacy of vicarious
atonement and they flouted the offer. The
uproar increased, curses and maledictions rung
out, the demand for the men grew louder and
louder, and at this perilous moment the angels
"put forth their hand and pulled Lot into the
house to them, and shut to the door," and
"They smote the men that were at the door of
the house with blindness, both small and great:
so that they wearied themselves to find the
door."</p>

<p>And in that crushing moment when eternal
darkness fell upon the multitude the cries of
anger and revenge died away, and such a moan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of anguish and despair burst upon the affrighted
night that the very stars in heaven trembled.</p>

<p>Then the angels confided to Lot their dread
secret and told him to warn all his relatives to
leave the city with him, and he went out and
told his sons-in-law of the impending calamity,
and he "seemed as one that mocked unto his
sons-in-law."</p>

<p>The morning came blue-eyed and blushing,
and the angels hastened Lot and his wife, and
hurried them out of the city, saying, "Escape
for thy life: look not behind thee, neither stay
thou in all the plains: escape to the mountains,
lest thou be consumed."</p>

<p>Now if there were any more disreputable
people in the cities than Lot's two young
daughters, we don't wonder that the vengeance
of a just God sent a blasting storm of bursting
flames to lick with their fiery tongues these
wicked cities from the face of the earth.
What does arouse our wonder is that those fair
girls with the devil's instincts smouldering in
their hearts should be allowed to escape the
general baking. But excuse us; our business is
to state facts and not to wonder or surmise.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>
<p class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Lots_wife_looked_back" id="Lots_wife_looked_back"></a>
<img src="images/image075.jpg" width="300" height="188" alt="(Lot&#39;s wife looked back.)" title="Lot&#39;s wife looked back." />
</p>

<p>From subsequent facts we
suppose that Lot's wife
sadly, perhaps rebelliously,
lingered, for we find the
angels saying again:</p>

<p>"Haste thee, escape thither;
for I cannot do anything till thou come
thither," and they escaped to the city of Zoar,
"and the sun was risen upon the face of the
earth when Lot entered into Zoar."</p>

<p>"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and
Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord
out of heaven."</p>

<p>But before the end Lot's "wife looked back
from behind him and she became a pillar of
salt."</p>

<p>All the information we have of Mrs. Lot is
exceedingly meager; only one short sentence
and two little clauses in other sentences; and
yet no figure of history, no creation of a poet's
dream or artist's brush since the world, wrapped
in the laces of the twilight and the mists, and
rocked in the cradle of the first early morning
of life, until the present day, old in experience,
wrinkled with care, heart-sick with too much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
knowledge and laughing without mirth, stands
out more clearly before the world than Lot's
wife&mdash;and why?</p>

<p>Because it has been supposed that she was
very naughty.</p>

<p>In this world it is the wicked folks who get
the glory and the everlasting fame; the good
people get the snubs, the crumbs, the eternal
oblivion.</p>

<p>The whole history of Lot's wife lies in the
fact that she was told by the angel of the Lord
to do one thing, and she&mdash;didn't do it.</p>

<p>But that is characteristic of the women of
old; they systematically didn't do it if they
were told to, and systematically did do it if
they were told not to.</p>

<p>And Madam Lot "became a pillar of salt,"
because of her disobedience, and has stood
through the centuries a warning statue to
naughty females; yes, more than that, for she
has seemed a criminal whom just vengeance
caught in the very act and turned into a pillar
of salt, standing in the plain near Sodom,
against a background of shame, crime and punishment,
that the eyes of the world of women
might look upon forever, and be afraid.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p><p>But in this day and age we are beginning to
see that in Lot's wife it was a case of mistaken
identity, and instead of being a criminal she
was a great and good woman, and although the
"pillar of salt" commemorates an act of dire
disobedience, it also extols a loving heart and
a brave act.</p>

<p>Just imagine her position. She was leaving
her home, around which a woman's heart
clings as the vine clings to the oak, her children,
her friends; breaking the ties that years
of association and friendship had woven about
her in chains of gold, and leaving them to a
terrible fate. But stronger than all these gossamer,
yet almost unbreakable threads, was the
love she bore her husband; a love so intense,
so deep that it made her obey a command of
God's against which every instinct, passion and
emotion of her nature rebelled.</p>

<p>He was going and her daughters were going
with him, and womanlike she forsook everything
to follow him&mdash;the man she loved; the
man whose frown could make her heart sore
as the wounds of death and agony, and her
heaven dark with the clouds of desolation and
despair; or whose gentle smile or caressing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
touch could sweep the mists of doubt and uncertainty
from her mind, even as June kisses
make June roses blossom, her weary eye glow
with the light that love alone can kindle, and
clothe rough labor in robes of splendor.</p>

<p>Softly the dawn awoke, gayly fell the sunlight
on the doomed cities, and joyously the
breezes swept the plains round about Sodom
and Gomorrah.</p>

<p>And Lot and his wife and daughters obeyed
the command: "Escape for thy life; look not
behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plains;
escape to the mountains lest thou be consumed."</p>

<p>And now with frantic haste Lot's wife urges
them on; she even leads the way in her mad
desire for their escape, encouraging them by
word, look and action. And while her heart is
a battle-ground where a desperate conflict is
raging, there is no hint of disobedience or
rebellion in her eyes, no lagging in her footstep,
no tears for love, no sighs for friendship,
no backward glance of compassion toward the
wicked but dear city.</p>

<p>And now they have come a long way&mdash;and
suddenly the sunshine grows dark, the wind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
falls, flutters, dies away; then comes the ominous
hush that foretells the bursting storm.</p>

<p>And this woman knows that her daughters
and her husband, the lover of her youth and
the lover of later years, in short the one loved
lover of her life, is safe; safe from the tempest
of destruction, safe from the wrath of God. A
wave of joy floods her heart at the thought.
No harm can touch them; she revels in that
assurance for a moment&mdash;and then she forgets
them.</p>

<p>The white-capped breakers of disobedience
against the cruel command "look not behind
thee" sweep with crushing force across her
soul; the unjust command that stifles compassion.
All the angels and demons, the joys and
sorrows of life, urge her to turn back; love of
children, friendship of old neighbors, regret for
the joys that have fled, remorse for the wicked
deeds she has done, the unkind words she has
spoken, a blind unreasoning rebellion against
the fate that has overtaken her friends and
home, fight against God's command. And in
that awful moment when the furious winds
strike her like angry hands, when Fear levels
his glittering dagger at her heart, Death holds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
his gleaming sword before her eyes, the heavens
disappear, hell sits enthroned in fiery flames
upon the clouds; above the deafening roar of
the maddened tempest the crashing thunder
that made the very dead tremble in the corruption
of their graves, and the awful surging of
the blazing rain, she heard God's command
ringing out "Look not behind thee."</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
<a name="Look_not_behind_thee" id="Look_not_behind_thee"></a>
<img src="images/image080.jpg" width="460" height="280" alt="(Look not behind thee.)" title="Look not behind thee." />
</p>

<p>For an instant she paused to cast an ineffable
smile of love upon the cherished ones
at her side, and then before the eyes of unborn
millions, while all the hosts of heaven and even
God himself stood appalled at her daring, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
slowly and deliberately turned and looked
back; and that one glance showed her a sight
that froze her into a beautiful statue of disobedience,
love and compassion.</p>

<p>She was loving, tender, daring&mdash;but disobedient!</p>

<p>Oh, that we might find one woman in the
Old Testament meek and humble, to whom we
could pin a faith, not born of teaching and
preaching and general belief, that such a thing
as a submissive, obedient, tractable woman or
wife ever did exist.</p>

<p>At the command of his mother, let it be
remembered, and not because he had any particular
desire to do so himself, Jacob left home
and departed unto the land of his mother's
people, where she told him to seek a wife.</p>

<p>The life of many men of the Old Testament
(after they have reached man's estate, I mean)
begins with a love affair, and I infer from that,
that the Bible means to teach the lesson that
to love is the first and best business of life, as
well as the most entertaining and pleasant thing
that this world ever did or ever will have to
offer.</p>

<p>And Jacob reached the land of Laban, his
mother's brother, and stopped by a well where
the flocks were watered. This is the second
well which figures conspicuously in a love story
of the Bible, and we imagine they were the
trysting places of the ancient young lovers.</p>

<p>While Jacob was loitering and gossiping
with the young men he found there, "and while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her
father's sheep; for she kept them."</p>

<p>Now "Rachel was beauteous and well favored,"
and of course Jacob saw all this at a
glance, for a man never yet needed a telescope
and a week's time to decide whether a woman
possessed the elements which constituted beauty
in his mind or not, and so Jacob gallantly rolled
the stone away from the well and watered the
flock of Laban, and then, with all the boldness
which characterized his future notorious career,
he "kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and
wept."</p>

<p>As there could hardly be anything but
pleasure in kissing a lovely maiden, we naturally
infer that Jacob was very emotional and
was crying for effect, and that Rachel, with the
consummate tact that all the women of the
Bible displayed when managing the men, perfectly
understood this, and had as little respect
for him at the moment as most women have for
a tearful man. A man like Jacob cries easily,
and when he thus "lifted up his voice and
wept," it is to be hoped the girl entirely understood
him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p><p>And Jacob's kiss is the first one that love
ever pressed upon the lips of a blushing maid&mdash;at
least it is the first one that is authoritatively
recorded.</p>

<p>At that time Jacob started a fashion that
"custom cannot stale," a fashion that while
time lasts shall be as cheap as roses, laughter
and sunshine, as thrilling as wine, as sweet as
innocence and as new as love, a fashion that
wealth, time or country cannot monopolize, and
one that is as sweet to the beggar, and
sweeter too, than to the king.</p>

</p>

<p>At the end of one
short month we
find him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
so desperately enamored that he said to Laban,
Rachel's father: "I will serve thee seven years
for thy younger daughter;" and the old gentleman,
seeing an opportunity to get a hired man
cheap, consented.</p>

<p>"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel,
and they seemed unto him but a few days for
the love he had to her."</p>

<p>What a world of devotion that one sentence
reveals. As we read that we forget all about
the prosaic age in which we live; forget the
modern I'll-give-you-a-brown-stone-front-and-diamonds-in-exchange-for-your-youth-and-beauty-love,
and believe in the kind that makes
a man a god and a woman an angel, and we
imagine that an affection so intense and deep
that it could make seven weary years of labor
"seem but a few days" must be as constant as
the flowing tide, as steadfast as the stars&mdash;and
then after a while we are desperately, despairingly
sorry that we have read any further than
that verse because we are so sadly disillusioned.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;AND JACOB SERVED SEVEN YEARS FOR RACHEL.&quot;</span>
</p>

<p>For a little further on we find that Jacob
wasn't as shrewd about getting married as he
was about breeding cattle that were ring-streaked
and grizzled, and so Laban, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
cunning of a modern politician, palmed off his
daughter Leah on Jacob as a bride. But the
next morning, when he discovered the trick,
there were probably matinees, side-shows and
circuses in the tent of Laban, and finally the
upshot of the whole affair was that he agreed
to serve seven years more for Rachel, and then
married her also. Far be it from me to disparage
Jacob's love, but we cannot help but
notice that we have no inspired statement saying
that the seven years he served for Rachel,
after he had married her, "seemed but a few
days for the love he had to her."</p>

<p>But we can't censure him for that, for as we
read we discover that in his earnest and constant
endeavor to save his precious person he
had no time to nurture his love. For the two
wives, the two sisters, were madly jealous of
each other of course (and we can't blame them
either, for there never was a man so great that
he could be divided between two wives, several
handmaids and more concubines, and be enough
of him to go around satisfactorily) and they
made his life a howling wilderness.</p>

<p>Leah, poor thing, longed for her fraudulent
husband's love, and he hated her. Rachel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
"envied her sister," and "Jacob's anger was
kindled against Rachel," and altogether the
picture of their home is not very enticing, and
having gotten thus far we are more than ever
convinced that we do not want to follow the
example of the "holy women" of old, as Peter
complimentarily, but ignorantly, calls them.</p>

<p>And Rachel and Leah, in order to spite and
humble each other, each gave her maid "to
Jacob to wife" and strange as it may seem, he
accepted them both. It was like him.</p>

<p>Now about this time Leah's son "found
mandrakes in the field" and brought them to
his mother. We suppose Rachel had a sweet
tooth from the fact that a little further on we
find her offering to sell her husband for one
night to Leah, for some mandrakes, whatever
they were; and we notice that women held
their husbands rather cheap in those good old
days.</p>

<p>You see Rachel and Leah made Jacob a
thing of barter and sale and (without consulting
his desires) Leah consummated the bargain,
and she went out toward the field when the
harvest was progressing, and met Jacob as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
came from his work tired and dusty, and informed
him he must come with her, "For surely
I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes,"
and he did not resent the insulting idea that he
had been "hired," but like all the other distractingly
obedient men of the Bible&mdash;he went.</p>

<p>Rachel next distinguishes herself as a disobedient
daughter and headstrong wife by
"stealing her father's gods" without consulting
or confiding in her husband, for we read that
"Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them."</p>

<p>And Laban, Rachel's father, and Jacob had
a lively altercation, and they said exceedingly
naughty things to each other in loud voices, but
at last they came to an agreement, and Laban
said he would give up his children, grandchildren
and cattle, but he was bound to have his
"gods" or know the reason why. The entire
story is a curious mixture of heathenism and
belief in one God.</p>

<p>Then Jacob rose in all the confidence of
perfect innocence and told him he might search
the whole camp for all he cared, and he added
in his outraged dignity, "with whomsoever thou
findest thy gods, let him not live."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p><p>You will observe by that that it was a terrible
crime to steal "gods," and as it is the first
offense of the kind on record, you can infer
what a reckless, ungovernable female Rachel
must have been to do so dreadful an act.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="She_hoped_he_would_excuse-her_for_not_arising" id="She_hoped_he_would_excuse-her_for_not_arising"></a>
<img src="images/image094.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="(She hoped he would excuse her for not arising.)" title="She hoped he would excuse her for not arising." />
</p>

<p>Well, Laban went like a cyclone "unto Jacob's
tent" (notice what humiliation and disgrace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Rachel subjected her husband to, and what a
scandal it must have raised in the neighborhood),
and into Leah's tent and into the two
maid-servants' tents; but he found them not.
Then he entered into Rachel's tent.</p>

<p>Now she had hidden the precious little
images in the camel's furniture and sat upon
them, and she said she didn't feel very well this
morning, papa dear, or words to that effect,
and she hoped he would excuse her for not
arising; and she probably smiled sweetly, put
her arm around his neck, and finally did him
up completely by kissing him tenderly; and of
course, as in those days men never dreamed of
asking a woman to do anything she didn't want
to do, papa dear did not insist upon her arising,
and so missed his sole and only chance of
getting his "gods."</p>

<p>It was a very serious and perhaps terrible
loss to her father, and we can gather no idea
from the scripture why she did it unless out of
pure spite, or else she wanted to use them as
bric-a-brac in the new home to which she was
going.</p>

<p>In the history of the "beauteous and well-favored"
Rachel and the "tender-eyed" Leah,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
we find hatred, deadly jealousy, anger, strife,
dissensions and envy, but none of the forbearance,
self-sacrifice, obedience, meekness and
submission that we have been taught that the
ladies of the Old Testament possessed, and we
are almost sorry that we didn't take the preacher's
"say so" for it, instead of studying the
Bible diligently and intelligently for ourselves.</p>

<p>The next young lady whom the Old Testament
presents for our admiration and edification
is Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, who
set the passionate but agonizing style of "loving
not wisely, but too well," and brought about one
of the shrewdest military stratagems that was
ever perpetrated, a terrible massacre, and the
slavery of many innocent women and children.</p>

<p>Several other ladies are mentioned casually
and then we come to Tamar, whose father-in-law,
Judah, had broken his solemn promise and
defrauded her of her rights. And did she submissively
consent to be deprived of her just
dues? Not at all. She simply disguised herself,
and by deception and a thorough knowledge
of man's nature, mixed up with a shrewd
business tact, completely out-generaled her dear
papa-in-law, gained her revenge, and by a sagacious
artifice protected herself from the possible
consequences of her folly and from future punishment
by persuading Judah to give her, as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
pledge of his good faith, "his signet and bracelets
and staff." In short, she was the original
pawn-broker of the world; and Judah left his
treasures "in escrow" until he could redeem
them by delivering her a kid in liquidation of
his debt.</p>

<p>And for many days the sun blazed and
faded, the stars sparkled and paled, and the
moon rode high in silvery radiance; the winds
and birds and flowers blushed and sang and
sighed, and in due course of time Judah sent a
kid to redeem his valuables, but alas! Tamar
had slipped away and left no trace by which
she could be identified, and Judah, who had
broken his pledge, was left in suspense.</p>

<p>But finally the time of retribution came, as
come it does and must to every possessor of a
pawn ticket. The days, those bright beads on
the rosary of time, were counted one by one
and shadows began to gather about the fair
name of Tamar. Then the whispers of suspicion
grew to pealing thunders of scandal which
reached and shocked the good Judah, and he
rose up in his moral rectitude and righteous indignation
at such depravity and cried: "Bring
her forth and let her be burnt."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p><p>But my lady, with a woman's wit, had foreseen
this possible denouncement and punishment,
and prepared for it, and she quietly sent
the articles he had left in pawn, and humbled
him to the very dust with her message.</p>

<p>"Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the
signet and bracelets and staff?" And I will add
here that there was no fire, because Tamar skillfully
avoided being the fuel.</p>

<p>I do not relate the above to harrow up your
feelings, but simply to show you the stuff the
women of the Old Testament were made of.</p>

<p>About this time the matchless Joseph appears
upon the stage of the Old Testament as
the monument of masculine virtue, and lo! the
woman in the case enters upon the scene in the
shape of Potiphar's wife, and plays her part in
the comedy or tragedy&mdash;as you happen to look
at it&mdash;in Joseph's life.</p>

<p>She doesn't come before the public with a
burst of melody, a blaze of light and the enticing
music of applause, but she enters softly,
quietly she "casts her eyes upon Joseph" and
she sees he is "a goodly person and well favored"&mdash;and
the mischief is done. She lavished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
her wealth in all the follies, fashions and pleasures
of her time to attract him; she met him in
the hall, gave him roses in the garden, smiled
at him from the doorway. When she slept she
dreamed sweet dreams of kisses and soft hand-clasps.
When she lifted her gaze to the stars,
'twas his eyes she saw there. When she
walked by the river's side, the rippling waters
were no sweeter than his voice. When the
summer wind, perfume-laden, fanned her face
she fancied 'twas his warm breath on her cheek.
Then she forgot husband and duty, heaven and
hell, and she listened for his footsteps, lingered
for his coming, watched and waited for his
smile&mdash;and all in vain.</p>

<p>And Joseph, who loved this woman with an
incomparable love; this woman who from the
eminence of her wealth, rank and beauty, in the
utter abandonment of her passion cast herself
at his feet, Joseph was man enough to bend and
sway and falter before her temptations, but for
friendship's sake, for honor's sake, for the sake
of her he loved, divine enough to resist them.</p>

<p>Out from among the seductive fables and
shocking facts of history Joseph stands forth a
shining example as the first man, and perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the last, who loved a woman so well that he
refused her outstretched arms, declined the
kisses from her lips, rejected the reckless invitation
in her eyes, and saved her from himself.
Who loved with a passion so tender and deep
that, unlike all other men, he refused to make
her he loved a victim on the altar of his passions,
but would have enshrined her there a goddess,
"pure as ice and chaste as snow."</p>

<p>Men have always sacrificed women "who
loved not wisely, but too well" upon the altar
of their own selfishness, but Joseph saved her
and taught the world what true love is.</p>

<p>The facts of history stab our faith in man's
love, woman's constancy, friendship, honor and
truth, but Joseph's peerless example revives it,
and we feel that there are characters that are
incorruptible, honesty that is unassailable, virtue
that is impregnable and friendship that is undying.
He shines out from among the other
characters of the Old Testament as distinctly
and clearly as a star breaking through the sullen
clouds of heaven, as a lily blowing and floating
above the green scum and sluggish waters, as a
rose blooming in a wilderness. Thank the Lord
for Joseph!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p><p>But Potiphar's wife, womanlike, scorned a
love that would make her an angel instead of a
victim, and by a succession of plausible, neat
little lies, gained her husband's ear, had Joseph
cast into prison, and teaches us that, indeed,
"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."</p>

<p>But what we wanted to say was, that she was
a faithless wife, a reckless lover, a revengeful
and unforgiving woman, since Joseph was left
to languish in captivity for two long years,
without any effort on her part, as far as we can
learn or infer, to accomplish his release.</p>

<p>At this period in the history of the Jews a
new king arose in Egypt, and fearing the great
number of the Jews, he "set over them task-masters,
to afflict them with their burdens;"
"but the more they afflicted them the more they
multiplied and grew."</p>

<p>Then the king, in the usual arrogance of
power, ignorantly supposing that women were
obedient and never dreaming they would dare
to disregard the commands of royalty, spoke to
the Hebrew midwives, and in the easy, off-hand
manner that kings had in those days, told
them to kill all the boy babies that came to the
Jews, but to save the girl babies alive.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p><p>And did they do it? Not at all! They simply
looked at each other, laughed at the king,
and utterly ignored his commands, and then
when majesty in dread power called them to
account, with a shrewdness characteristic of the
females of the Old Testament they invented a
plausible excuse, baffled the king, shielded the
Jews and saved themselves.</p>

<p>So the king was balked by the Hebrew
midwives and the Jews continued to "increase
abundantly and multiplied, and waxed exceeding
mighty; and the land was filled with them."</p>

<p>And the king, fearing the multitude of the
Jews, again pitted himself against the fecundity
and rebellion of the women, and issued the
cruel but famous command:</p>

<p>"And Pharaoh charged all the people, saying,
Every son that is born ye shall cast into
the river, and every daughter ye shall save
alive."</p>

<p>And shortly after that, one night when all
the Egyptians slept, and only the stars, the
moon and the winds were awake, in the silence
and the silvery gloom, a baby boy came to a
daughter of Levi, and "when she saw him that
he was a goodly child" she quietly determined
that no murderous hand should ever toss him
in the rolling river, or check the breath on his
sweet lips; "and she hid him three months."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p><p>I don't know how she did it, but perhaps
when he was crying with all a baby's vigor for
his supper the embryo diplomat in his heart
shrewdly caught the meaning in his mother's
warning "hush, sh!" and, king and tyrant tho'
he was, he knew "that there was a greater than
he," and stilled his cries. Perhaps when the
colic gripped his vitals he bore the pain in unflinching
silence, if he heard an Egyptian footstep
near the door. Perhaps he stopped his
gooing and cooing in his hidden nest, and held
his very breath in fear, when he heard an
Egyptian voice in the house.</p>

<p>And all these three months he had been
growing plump, and strong and healthy, and I
suppose he became a little reckless, or perchance
he began to think he knew more than
his mother did about it, and wouldn't keep still.
Anyway, whatever was the matter I don't know,
but there came a day when "she could no
longer hide him," and then she laid a plot to
baffle the king, defeat death and save the child.</p>

<p>Being an ambitious woman as well as a loving
mother, she was not content that he should
be as other children, forced "to serve with
rigor" and his life made "bitter with hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
bondage in mortar and brick and in all manner
of service of the field." I presume she thought
he was a little more beautiful and more clever
than any child that ever lived before, for we all
do that when a baby comes without an invitation
and often against our most urgent wishes,
and nestling in our arms says, without uttering
a word: "I've come to stay and I want my
supper; I'm hungry, for the journey has been
long and dark&mdash;and why don't you make
haste?"</p>

<p>Perhaps she had caught the fire of the future
statesman in his dark eye; perhaps she had
heard the ring of sublimity in the melodious
voice that afterward said "Honor thy father
and thy mother." Perhaps she had seen the
shrewdness of the future great diplomat in his
maneuvers to have his baby way, and being a
bright woman she set her wits to work to defy
the king, defeat his law and elude the cruel
vigilance of the Egyptian spies; and she conceived
a plot which for boldness of thought and
shrewdness of execution stands unsurpassed.
She would not save him to live the toilsome,
slavish life of the Jews. She sighed for all the
advantages of the Egyptians. She lifted her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
ambitious eyes to the royal household itself, and
in spite of the accident of birth, in spite of king
and law and hatred, in spite of the fatal fact
that he was a dark-eyed, dark-haired Jew, she
vowed he should mingle with royal nabobs,
laugh and thrive and prosper under the very
eye of his enemy the king, be clothed in purple
and fine linen, skilled in all the arts and learned
in all the sciences of the Egyptians; and she
was clever enough to see at a glance that in
this almost hopeless scheme she must have
accomplices.</p>

<p>And where did she turn for aid? To her
husband, as a meek, submissive and obedient
woman naturally would? Not at all. Perhaps
she doubted the intelligence of his assistance.
Perhaps she had no faith in his courage for the
undertaking. Perhaps she did not believe he
could keep a secret; at any rate she refused
to confide in him. I suppose, as no mention is
made of it, she utterly ignored him, scorned to
ask his advice, and planned to dispose of his
child without telling him of it, much less asking
his permission.</p>

<p>But where did she turn for aid? Did she
clothe herself in the gayest costume of the Jews,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
and, conscious of her beauty, try with smiles
and coquetry and caressing touch to beguile
the King? No. Did she steal into the tent of
his greatest general and kneeling at his feet
seek to bribe him with her love? No. She
simply and utterly ignored the men, and selected
the King's own daughter as the instrument to
execute her design. She knew the royal girl
came down to the river to bathe, and trusting
in her baby's great gift of unrivaled beauty
and the woman's compassion, she planned a
dramatic surprise for her.</p>

<p>"And when she could not longer hide him,
she took him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed
it with slime and pitch and put the child
therein. And she laid it among the flags by
the river's brink." But before she put him in
it she bathed him in perfumed water to make
him sweet, put on his prettiest dress, tied up
his short sleeves with something that just
matched the color in his cheeks, and borrowed
a golden chain of an Egyptian woman to clasp
about his milk-white neck. Then she lined the
ark with roses, laid a little pillow in the bottom,
put the baby softly in, partly closed the top to
shield him from too much light and air, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
laid it among the flags by the river's brink; and
then the cleverness that had designed the
scheme and the bravery that had executed it so
far, was overwhelmed by a mother's love and
she fled, and hid herself among the foliage and
the reeds, too frightened to watch the result;
"but his sister stood afar off to wit what
would be done to him."</p>

<p>And the baby had a nice time while he
waited, for the wind with noiseless feet and invisible
hands came and softly rocked the cradle
to and fro; the sunbeams sent a bright ray and
put golden bracelets on his wrists, which with
the true instinct of human nature he tried to
catch and hold, and the birds coming down to
wash in the rippling waters peeped into the
cradle, and, enraptured with the pretty sight,
forgot to bathe, but stopped to sing.</p>

<p>And the King's daughter and her maidens
came laughing and singing down to the river's
brink to bathe, as was their custom&mdash;a custom
which baby's mother knew about and took
advantage of.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;PUT UP HIS HANDS IN WELCOME AND SAID &#39;AH, GOO! AH, GOO!&#39;&quot;</span>
</p>

<p>And the girls spied the basket and wondered
what it was, and finally the royal damsel "sent
her maid to fetch it." And Pharaoh's daughter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
opened it and "she saw the child," and the
girls crowded around and gazed in silent admiration.
Then the baby, who never before had
seen the purple and fine linen of majesty or the
sparkling jewels of wealth, knowing this was
the opportunity of his life put up his hands in
welcome and said in the universal language of
babyhood, "Ah, goo! ah, goo!" He was a
worthy child of a great mother, and the minute
he was left to himself he came before the footlights
and with one word captivated his audience,
and a storm of kisses fell upon his lips
and neck and arms. And when the girls ceased
lest they should kiss him to death, he looked
at them a minute, and then he opened his
mouth and laughed a little soft, gurgling laugh;
a laugh so sweet that I'm sure even the terrible
God of the Jews must have smiled had he
heard it.</p>

<p>He didn't laugh because he felt particularly
funny, but because the little diplomat, bent on
conquest, wanted to show a tiny tooth that
came into his mouth one day, he didn't know
how.</p>

<p>He had never seen it himself, but he knew
it was there and was a treasure, for one time in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the dead of the night when all his dread enemies,
the Egyptians, were fast asleep, and the
wind howled and the rain beat upon the roof,
his mother brought his father to his hiding
place and holding the light high up above his
head, she touched him lightly under the chin
and said: "Laugh, now, and show papa baby's
tooth." Then he did as he was told and his
father looked long and carefully and then
laughed too, kissed him and went away.</p>

<p>When the girls saw it they all smiled and
kissed him too.</p>

<p>About this time he wanted his mother and
"the babe wept."</p>

<p>When the king's daughter saw his red lips
quivering and the tears hanging on his long,
curling lashes, love and compassion filled her
heart, and thinking of her father's wicked command:
"Every son that is born ye shall cast
into the river," she said, sadly, "this is one of
the Hebrews' children."</p>

<p>Then his sister&mdash;I suppose it was the same
one who had "stood afar off to wit what
would be done to him" and who had approached&mdash;said,
"Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the
child for thee?"</p>

<p>"And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, 'Go.'
And the maid went and called the child's
mother."</p>

<p>"And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her,
'Take this child away and nurse it for me and
I will give thee thy wages.' And the woman
took the child and nursed it." Wasn't
that the sublimest conquering of ambition
and crime by love ever known?</p>

<p class="figright" style="width: 334px;">
<a name="And_every_kiss_strengthened_her_determination" id="And_every_kiss_strengthened_her_determination"></a>
<img src="images/image119.jpg" width="334" height="450" alt="(And every kiss strengthened her determination.)" title="And every kiss strengthened her determination." />
</p>

<p>I suppose the King's
daughter went every
day to see the little
black-eyed beauty
and kiss his rosy
lips, his soft white
neck, his dimpled
arms; and every
kiss strengthened
her determination to
defy the King, her
father and the
law, and save this
baby for her own.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p><p>I don't know how she managed it, but somehow
she overcame all obstacles, and they were
many and great there is no doubt, and "he
became her son," and the future lawgiver of
the Jews, and the world was saved.</p>

<p>And so after all we owe the ten commandments
to a Jewish woman's wit, strategy and
love, and an Egyptian woman's compassion
and disobedience, for the stern command that
"Every son that is born ye shall cast into the
river" was not given to the army, the navy or
the church, to one man or woman, to doctors
or midwives, but to "all the people," and in
this affair there were a number of women, who
all connived to foil the "powers that be" and
refused to do the King's bidding. First there
was the mother of Moses and the sister, the
King's daughter, her maid and "her maidens"
who came down to the river's brink with her,
at least two of them and perhaps twenty.</p>

<p>I fail to find in their example any of the
vaunted submission, obedience and docility we
have been taught by those who did not read
their Bible intelligently, or took some other
person's "say-so" for it, and which are the
vaunted characteristics of all these women.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p><p>They just simply scorned all the men and
the laws whenever they did not suit their ideas
of right and justice, and proceeded to have
their own way in spite of everything.</p>

<p>"And it came to pass in those days, when
Moses was grown, that he went out unto his
brethren and looked on their burdens, and he
spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of
his brethren.</p>

<p>"And he looked this way and that way, and
when he saw that there was no man, he slew
the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand."</p>

<p>Yet we are told a little farther on "Now the
man Moses was very meek, above all the men
which were upon the face of the earth." But
we haven't anything to do with his meekness,
and only mention the murder because thereby
hangs the tale of Moses' first love affair.</p>

<p>"Murder will out," and so in due course of
time the King heard about it and "sought to
slay Moses." "But Moses fled from the face
of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian,
and he sat down by a well."</p>

<p>Now when we read about the young men of
the Bible hanging around a "well" we know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
what is going to happen. There is romance in
the air and a love affair soon develops, for that
seems to have been love's trysting place. And
I suppose he neglected no artifice of the toilet
that might enchance his personal charms, that
he donned the most costly and elegant of his
Egyptian costumes, flung himself in courtly
indolence upon the sand, and waited and
watched eagerly for the rich girls to come
down to the well to water their father's flocks,
just as one watches in the twilight for the first
star to sparkle in the azure overhead, for the
first sunbeam of the morning or the first rose of
June.</p>

<p>"Now the priest of Midian had seven
daughters, and they came and drew water and
filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
And the shepherds came and drove them away,
but Moses stood up and helped them, and
watered their flock."</p>

<p>And who can blame Moses if he happened
to wear his best raiment? Everything and
everybody knows, and always has known, that
love loves the beautiful; and each one according
to his light takes advantage of the fact. So the
wild maiden, when love with magic finger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
touches her quivering heart, stains her teeth a
blacker black, hangs more beads and shells
about her dirty neck and ankles, and practices
all her rude arts of coquetry. And her savage
lover, charmed with her charms, sticks the gayest
feathers in his hair, rubs a more liberal supply
of grease upon his polished, shiny skin, and
makes himself brave with all his weapons of
war. So the birds only seek love's trysting
place in the springtime when their plumage is
the most brilliant and their songs the sweetest,
and the fishes when their colors are the brightest.
And the woman of our day and generation,
when love's arrow "tipped with a jewel
and shot from a golden string" pierces her vital
organ, wears her dress a little more d&eacute;collet&eacute;,
bangs her hair more bangy, clasps more diamonds
round her throat, dispenses with sleeves
altogether, smiles her sweetest smile and laughs
her gayest laugh. And he, the modern man,
caught in the snare, buys the shiniest stovepipe
hat and nobbiest cane, dons his gaudiest neck-tie
and widest trousers&mdash;and after all, beasts
and birds and fishes, savage and civilized, we
are all alike and ruled by the same instinct and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
passion, and "why should the spirit of mortal
be proud?"</p>

<p>I presume Zipporah, one of the priest's
daughters, had heard about the elegant and
courtly Egyptian who was in the neighborhood,
and she no doubt adorned herself with all her
jewels, wore the finest finery in her wardrobe
and wreathed her lips in smiles; for she knew
that love lives and thrives on smiles and roses,
coquetry and gallantry, on laughter and sweet
glances, and faints and dies on frowns, neglect
and angry words; and so she tripped down to
the well, bent on conquest. Then she flung
back the drapery to show her dimpled arms,
and drawing water filled the trough; then the
"shepherds came and drove them away; but
Moses stood up and helped them, and watered
their flocks." Was he not gallant, and a striking
contrast to the ugly shepherds?</p>

<p>And of course Moses told her that it almost
broke his heart to see her performing such
menial labor, and all such sweet fictitious stuff,
and she glanced at him admiringly from under
her long, curling lashes, and the "rebel rose hue
dyed her cheek," and he told her about the
great court where he had been reared, and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
whispered that her papa was the rich priest of
Midian; then they clasped hands lingeringly and
said a soft good-night.</p>

<p>It seems the old gentleman kept a pretty
close watch on his girls&mdash;and he doubtless had
a steady job&mdash;for he asked them how it happened
that they had returned so soon. And
Zipporah put her arms around his neck, and
placing her cheek against his told him all about
the gallant and courteous stranger. Having an
eye to business&mdash;as behooves a father with
seven daughters on his hands&mdash;he didn't let
this eligible young person slip, but sent and invited
him to his house and deluged him with
hospitality and kindness&mdash;and Moses and Zipporah
were married "and Moses
was content to dwell
with the man."</p>

<p class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

</p>

<p>But after a while,
first soft and low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
and then in trumpet tones, ambition whispered
in his ear that he could deliver the Hebrews
from their enemies. "And Moses took his wife
and sons and set them upon an ass, and he
returned to the land of Egypt."</p>

<p>And I suppose, though time was young and
wore roses then, the days passed slowly to
Zipporah and she grew tired of Moses and the
Lord, tired of the rod that turned into a serpent,
of the strife and the bondage and the
river of blood; tired of the frogs and the lice
and the swarms of flies; disgusted with the
murrain of beasts and the boils and terrified at
the thunder and fire and rain of hail and all the
horrors of Egypt, and like the woman of to-day,
when things get too awfully unpleasant, she
made it uncomfortable for Moses, and "he sent
her back" to her father's house and she took
her two sons with her.</p>

<p>Afterward when Moses became famous and
illustrious she returned to him without asking
his consent, or even notifying him of her intention,
as far as we can learn from the official
records.</p>

<p>She took her father, the priest Jethro, along
to look after her and take care of her baggage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
I suppose, and we imagine he didn't relish the
task much, for we hear him saying, rather apologetically
we think, "I, thy father-in-law Jethro,
am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two
sons with her."</p>

<p>I fancy Moses knew the condition of a man
who was in the clutches of a woman, and that
woman his wife, so he forgave the old man,
for he had experience himself, "and went out
to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance,
and kissed him; and they asked each other of
their welfare." But there isn't any record that
he kissed his wife, or even shook hands with
her, and we infer that their domestic heaven
was not all blue and cloudless.</p>

<p>Miriam, although a prophetess and a sister
of Aaron, was't very angelic, at least the
glimpses we catch of her don't impress us with
the fact that she was. When the seashore was
strewn with the dead, white faces of the
drowned Egyptians, and the waves were flecked
with their pallor and dashed their helpless arms
about, Miriam "took a timbrel in her hand:
and all the woman went out after her with timbrels
and with dances." And Miriam answered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
them, "Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed
gloriously: the horse and his rider
hath he thrown into the sea."</p>

</p>

<p>Now this may have
been natural and
all right for the
times, only you
know it don't look well
when
compared with
the action of our women of to-day, who drop
tears and roses on the graves of their enemies.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p><p>Further on we find Miriam, womanlike,
talking about Moses because he had married
an Ethiopian woman, and saying seditiously
to Aaron, "Hath the Lord indeed spoken only
by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us?"</p>

<p>And the Lord heard it and his anger "was
kindled against them," and my lady "became
leprous, white as snow."</p>

<p>As she was the one punished for daring to
talk rebellion against Moses, God's chosen one,
we suppose she was the ringleader and instigator,
and Aaron was only the tool in this plot
that budded but never bloomed.</p>

<p>"And Aaron looked upon Miriam, and
behold, she was leprous," and of course she
threw her arms around his neck and with
streaming eyes besought his aid, and Aaron
turned the smoothly flowing river of his eloquence
into resistless words of appeal and said
unto Moses, while Miriam knelt at his feet:
"Alas, my Lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin
upon us," and "let her not be as one dead;"
and Moses, moved, as men have always been
moved, by woman's tears, "cried unto the Lord,
saying, Heal her now, O, God I beseech thee,"
and after seven days the curse was removed.</p>

<h2><a name="SOME_MANAGING_WOMEN" id="SOME_MANAGING_WOMEN"></a>SOME MANAGING WOMEN.</h2>


<p>The women of the Old Testament always
wanted something, and it is a noticeable fact
that they always asked for it&mdash;and got it too.</p>

<p>So the daughters of Zelophehad had a grievance,
and they didn't go among the neighbors
bewailing their hard lot, they didn't sit and
wish from morning till night that something
would turn up to help them, or sigh their lives
away in secret, but they put on their most
radiant attire and jauntiest veils and "stood
before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest,
and before the princes and all the congregation,"
and demanded their father's possessions,
and even argued the question reasonably and
logically. There was not any of the St.
Paul-women-should-not-speak-in-meeting doctrine
about the Biblical women of those elder days.</p>

<p>They didn't endeavor to persuade Moses'
wife to influence her husband to use his power
in their behalf. They did not retain the services
of Aaron, the finest orator of the day, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
plead their cause, but they did their own talking,
and they got what they asked for&mdash;their
father's possessions&mdash;and husbands thrown in
without extra charge. Being clever as well as
ambitious women, they probably foresaw that
husbands would follow after the inheritance,
and although they would not ask for lords and
masters of course, they had their eyes on them
just the same. As there were several of them,
all unmarried, they were no doubt <i>not</i> "fair to
look upon," so they laid a little plot to secure
husbands. And they succeeded and were
happy, for marriage was the aim and end of a
woman's existence then, and there was a better
market and more of a demand for husbands
than in these modern days.</p>

<p>We only catch a glimpse of one woman
named Achsah, but that is enough to show us
that she possessed the prevailing and prominent
characteristic of all the other "holy women."&mdash;she
wanted something.</p>

<p>After she had married her warrior lover,
who conquered Kirpathsepher for her sweet
sake, the very first thing we find is that "she
moved him to ask of her father a field." Now
naturally a young man would dislike to approach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
his father-in-law upon such a delicate subject,
and so soon too, but <i>she</i> asked him and he
obeyed&mdash;like all the men of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>And even then she was not satisfied; but of
course she embraced her father and kissed him,
and told him he was the most
indulgent father in the whole wide world.</p>

<p>Now Caleb no doubt
had had dozens of love
affairs, and experience
had made him a connoisseur
of female character,
and understanding all their
little scheming ways and
little designing tricks, without
beating around the bush
at all he came to business at
once and asked,</p>

<p>"What would'st thou?"</p>

<p class="figright" style="width: 273px;">
<a name="What_wouldst_thou" id="What_wouldst_thou"></a>
<img src="images/image139.jpg" width="273" height="350" alt="(What wouldst thou?)" title="What wouldst thou" />
</p>

<p>"Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me
a south land, give me also springs of water,"
she said.</p>

<p>Springs of water were a bonanza in those
days&mdash;something like a gold or silver mine to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
us moderns&mdash;but she had requested it and of
course he could not refuse, "and he gave her
the upper springs and the nether springs."</p>

<p>And it came to pass that Joshua sent two
men, two spies, saying, "Go view the land, even
Jericho," and I suppose they disguised themselves
and went by secret ways; anyway they
eluded the vigilance of their enemies and
entered the city, even Jericho, and let me whisper
it in your ear, they went to see a woman
named Rahab&mdash;and she wasn't a very nice
woman either&mdash;and "lodged there."</p>

<p>But their visit leaked out, as such things
always do and always will, though the stars
should pale their fires to shield them, the moon
withdraw behind the clouds to hide their
shadows, the rain pour and the thunder crash
to drown their footsteps. Perhaps the children
told the neighbors, perhaps the hired girl
whispered to her friend, perhaps some jealous
watching lover told of it, but at any rate we
read:</p>

<p>"And it was told to the King of Jericho,
saying: Behold there came two men in hither
to-night of the children of Israel, to search out
the country."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p><p>"And the King of Jericho sent unto Rahab,
saying: Bring forth the men that are come to
thee, which are entered into thy house: for
they be come to search all the country."</p>

<p>Now does one suppose for a moment that
she obeyed the mandate of the King? Of course
not, if one is a student of the Bible, but if one
is not, I'll just say that she took them up
through the skylight and hid them, piling flax
over them, and then she said innocently and
convincingly to the King's officers:</p>

<p>"There came two men unto me, but I wist
not whence they were: And it came to pass
about the time of shutting of the gate, when it
was dark, that the men went out: pursue after
them quickly; for ye shall overtake them."</p>

<p>Then she went up on the roof and talked to
the men like a lawyer. I notice that these old
women&mdash;I mean women of old&mdash;were all good
talkers, and they didn't speak like meek, passive,
submissive girls wrought up to sudden
action by wrong, indignation or revenge, but
they spoke with a freedom, vigor and fluency
that betokened everyday practice.</p>

<p>St. Paul says that woman should "Keep
silence," and that "they are commanded to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
under obedience," but he evidently had some
remarkable ideas upon this and other topics.
Perhaps he never had read the official records,
and we know he was never married, and so we
don't censure him so much for his ignorance of
female character, having never had a wife, or,
so far as we know, a love affair, for what does
a man born blind know about the sunshine, or
the lightning's awful flash, or one born deaf
know of the pealing, clashing thunder?</p>

<p>The women of his day were no doubt obstreperous
and extravagant, and hence his
famous but perfectly ineffectual teaching that
they should not "broider their hair, or wear
gold or silver or costly array," and that they
shouldn't talk in meeting, and if they wanted
to know anything, ask their husbands, and
drink of their intellectual superiority. But to
return.</p>

<p>So Rahab made the spies swear that when
the doom of destruction fell upon Jericho, she
and her father and mother and all her relations-in-law
should be saved, and then she let them
down from the window of her house, which
was very conveniently built upon the town wall,
with a scarlet rope.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p><p>So you see, by deceit, strategy, disobedience
and a succession of neat little lies, she thwarted
the King, betrayed the city, and
saved her own precious self
all at one fell swoop.</p>

<p class="figright" style="width: 374px;">
<a name="She_let_them_down_from_the_window_of_her_house" id="She_let_them_down_from_the_window_of_her_house"></a>
<img src="images/image143.jpg" width="374" height="580" alt="(She let them down from the window of her house.)" title="She let them down from the window of her house." />
</p>

<p>When the walls of Jericho
fell and childhood in its
innocence, ambitious manhood,
fiery youth, despairing
maidens and loving
mothers, were swept by
maddening flames and glittering
swords into the
oblivion called death, from
whose silent gloom no smile
or tear, no laughter or wail,
ever yet has come, then
Rahab and all that she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
was saved. She had asked it, and schemed for
it, and of course she did not fail.</p>

<p>Next we come to Deborah, a prophetess,
who judged Israel at that time, and from the
little that is said of her husband, we infer she
was the head of the house and ruled him besides
attending to her professional duties.</p>

<p>Well, Deborah sent for Barak and commanded
him to meet "Sisera, the captain of
Jabin's army," in battle array. But he was
afraid, and to inspire him by her courageous
example she went with him to the field of battle,
and every man of Jabin's host "fell upon
the edge of the sword; and there was not a man
left." But Sisera "fled away on his feet" to
Jael, the wife of his friend. Sisera, like another
defeated general, had lost his horse.</p>

<p>And she went out to meet him, and gained
his entire confidence by smiles and deception,
and took him into her tent and gave him milk
to drink, covered him with a mantle, and said
in her sweetest tones, "Fear not." Then when
he slept the sleep of perfect exhaustion, defeat
and despair, she "took a nail of the tent, and a
hammer in her hand," and softly, with bated
breath and step that often paused and ear that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
bent to listen, she approached him, and then&mdash;quicker
than the lightning's flash or tiger's
spring "she smote the nail into his temples, and
fastened it into the ground: and he was fast
asleep and weary. So he died."</p>

<p>Nice way for a woman to
treat her husband's friend,
wasn't it?</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">

</p>

<p>Abimelech killed seventy
of his brothers to become
King, and after wars and
battles too numerous to mention he came to
"Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and
took it." But there was a strong and mighty
tower in the city and a thousand men and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
women, stained with blood, expecting no mercy,
but defiant to the last, fled there for a few hours
of safety.</p>

<p>"And Abimelech came unto the tower and
fought against it, and went hard unto the door
of the tower to burn it with fire."</p>

<p>And all the men stood aghast, helpless and
despairing, waiting a terrible death. Then a
woman with a vision of blood and moans, dying
men and ravished women before her, with a
courage born of desperation and a wit sharpened
with intense fear, boldly stepped to the window
ledge, and in the glare of bursting flames and
the sound of dying groans "cast a piece of a
millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to
break his skull."</p>

<p>"Then he called hastily unto the young man
his armour-bearer, and said unto him, Draw thy
sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A
woman slew me. And his young man thrust
him through, and he died," as a man naturally
would who had been hit on the head with a millstone
and pierced through with a sword; and
every one in the tower was saved.</p>

<p>I'm not telling you this to harrow up your
feelings, but just to show you that the holy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
women of old were not such nonentities as
some of us have supposed.</p>

<p class="figright" style="width: 355px;">

<p>And time, undelayed by the roses
of June or the snows of winter, by
sunshine or starshine, by laughter
or sighs, by birth or death, hurried
on and the Jews fought and
triumphed, bled and died "and
did evil, and the Lord delivered
them into the hands of the
Philistines." And after a
while Samson was born,
and what do you suppose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
he did just as soon as he became a man?
Why he went down to Timnath and fell
deeply, desperately, madly, in love with a Philistine
girl, and he went straight home and told
his father and mother about it and they did not
approve of it&mdash;they never do, it seems&mdash;but he
was determined to have her, for there was not
another female for him in the whole wide world&mdash;they
all think that for the time being&mdash;and
of course he married her. Then he made a
seven-day feast, and unfortunately he amused
the company with a riddle. Of course his wife
was dying to know the answer, and her people
threatened her if she did not find it out, and
altogether it was a lively discussion, and she
made his life a burden and a delusion and she
wept before him and said:</p>

<p>"Thou dost but hate me and lovest me not;
thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children
of my people and hast not told it to me." And
Samson declared he hadn't told it to his father
or mother or any living soul and swore he
would not tell <i>her</i>&mdash;but he did. For "she wept
before him the seven days while the feast
lasted," and on the seventh day, exhausted by
her upbraidings, deluged by her tears and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
wearied by her everlasting persistence, he whispered
it in her ear, and she told the children of
her people.</p>

<p>It is safe to conclude that Samson was
angry, and the wedding feast
broke up in confusion and
dismay, and he went and
killed thirty people, and the
woman who had "pleased him
well" he repudiated with such
dispatch that it suggests
Idaho and the modern man,
and "Samson's wife was given
to his companion, whom he
had used as a friend." The views we get of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
married life and the domestic relations in the
Old Testament make us almost think that marriage
was a failure&mdash;in those days.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<a name="And_she_betrayed_him" id="And_she_betrayed_him"></a>
<img src="images/image149.jpg" width="404" height="580" alt="(And she betrayed him.)" title="And she betrayed him." />
</p>

<p>Then Samson, after a little affair which I do
not care to dwell upon with a woman of Gaza,
who was no better than she should have been,
fell blindly in love with Delilah. And, being in
love, he profited not by his late experience
(what man or woman ever does who is in love?)
and again he told the dearest secret of his heart
to a woman, because, forsooth, "she pressed
him daily with her words, and urged him, so
that his soul was vexed unto death." And then
with her fine arms around his neck and her
kisses on his lips, he fell asleep on her knees&mdash;and
she betrayed him.</p>

<p>The great array of the Philistines "came
and pitched in Shunem, and Saul gathered
all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa,"
and unseen by any of the mighty hosts death
and rapine, treachery, revenge and murder,
smilingly waited for the desperate battle.</p>

<p>Then Saul, gazing upon the great army of
his enemies and terrified at the countless thousands,
thought he would like to have his fortune
told and said, "Seek me a woman that hath a
familiar spirit," and they took him to the witch
of Endor, and Saul prayed her to materialize
Samuel for his especial benefit. And did she
do it? Not at all, or at least not until she had
made her own conditions. "And Saul sware to
her by the Lord, saying: as the Lord liveth,
there shall no punishment happen to you
for this thing." And then having brought the
King to terms, by cunning hocus-pocus she
summoned Samuel from the cold, cold grave.
First there was a hush, then a sweeping in of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
chill, damp air, a scent of decay, the shaking
out of a shroud that never rustled, a rush of
silent footsteps, and suddenly the door untouched
swung noiselessly open and Samuel,
with the old regal air, but with the savor of
death clothing him like a mantle, and the
mildew of death on his brow, stood before them.</p>

<p>You will observe he was far too courteous a
ghost to censure a woman&mdash;who really was the
one who deserved it, since she had wrought the
mischief&mdash;but said sternly to Saul:</p>

<p>"Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me
up?"</p>

<p>The inference is that after all his triumphs
and defeats, his loves and illusions, his glory
and fall, he was taking the sweet and silent rest
of utter oblivion, and very naturally he did not
like to be disturbed, and so he told Saul
some things that very nearly scared the lingering
hope out of him, and almost reduced him
to a condition where he himself was a fit candidate
for a companionship with Samuel. Then
suddenly the air grew warmer and fresher, the
birds began to twitter in the first faint flush of
the morning, and looking around one could not
see Samuel any more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p><p>Then the witch of Endor wanted Saul to
take some refreshment, "But he refused and
said, I will not eat."</p>

<p>But the woman did not pay any attention to
his refusal, but killed a calf and cooked it, and
made some biscuits "and she brought it before
Saul, and before his servants, and they did eat"
of course, since she smilingly invited them to.</p>

<p>We suppose Saul's wife&mdash;at least one of
them&mdash;was a lady who carried things with a
high hand, ruled the servants, nagged her
husband, delivered curtain lectures by the hour,
scolded him to sleep and then scolded him
awake again.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And whipped the children, and fed the fowls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made his home resound with howls;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>since we hear him saying to his son Jonathan,
"Thou son of the perverse, rebellious woman."</p>

<p>And behold Saul and David were the firmest
friends, and every act of David's pleased Saul,
and every smile delighted him, and Saul honored,
trusted and advanced him, until the
women came to have a hand in the affair and
then all was changed.</p>

<p>It seems that no one had noticed, or dared
to give voice to the thought, that David was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
becoming a dangerous rival of the great King,
until the women, with keen penetration, looking
upon the handsome David, saw there was a
greater one than Saul. And so one day when
David returned from a great slaughter of the
Philistines, the girls came and danced and sung
and waved their white hands and smiled, and
despite the probable indignation of the King at
the open preference and approval of the young
man, they played and said, "Saul hath slain his
thousands, and David his ten thousands."</p>

<p>And Saul was jealous and "very wroth" and&mdash;well,
that ended that friendship, and it wasn't
the last time that women's smiles and honeyed
words of praise have blighted the friendship
between men "whose souls were knit together."</p>

<p>And there was a woman whose name was
Bath-sheba, and she was very beautiful. Her
midnight hair curled softly away from her
snowy brow, her long black lashes hiding her
love-lit eyes swept her rosy cheeks, and her
light step dashed the dew from the grass in the
garden, while the blossoms fell from the boughs
to kiss her shoulders as she passed.</p>

<p>And one eventide, David, walking upon the
roof of his palace, saw her bathing. And the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
last red rays of the sinking sun touched her
softly and changed her into a perfect statue of
warm pink marble, and David's soul was ravished
by her beauty; and with the impetuosity
of a king and the reckless passion of a lover he
sought to beguile her. And Bath-sheba, flattered
by the preference of the mighty King,
allured by imperial grandeur and enticed by
royal appeals, tried to forget the husband, who
was off to the wars and away, and who had
in the first flush of youth won her by his love,
his "brow of truth" and a soul untouched by
sin&mdash;but the King&mdash;the King, the pomp and
the power!</p>

<p>Ambition was roused in her heart and she
wanted to be clothed in the purple and fine
linen of majesty, and to wear a jeweled crown
upon her brow. And so she forgot a husband's
love, a wife's honor, a woman's virtue, and
while angels wept and devils laughed, the memory
of Uriah vanished from her mind as a star
vanishes before the fire-bursting storm-cloud.</p>

<p>Then black-browed conspiracy and red-handed
murder, the boon companions of unholy
love, whispered in their ears; and though a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
vision of Uriah often rose unbidden and unwelcome
before her, it was dimmed and obscured
by the glitter of jewels and the gleam of costly
array, that should yet flash upon her arms and
throat and clothe her limbs.</p>

<p>So David sent for Uriah (we presume with
the consent, perhaps at the instigation of Bath-sheba,
for there is no wickedness like the wickedness
of an ambitious, faithless wife), honored
and feasted him, and the favored young man,
happily unconscious of his wife's treachery,
perhaps dreaming bright waking dreams of the
wealth, fame and power he would win to lay at
Bath-sheba's feet, felt himself honored by being
made a special envoy to carry a letter from the
King to his greatest general, Joab&mdash;and in it
the King wrote:</p>

<p>"Set ye Uriah in the fore-front of the hottest
battle, and retire ye from him, that he may
be smitten and die;" and Joab "assigned Uriah
unto a place where he knew the valiant men
were," and he was smitten and died.</p>

<p>And David and Bath-sheba were married,
but surely, as they stood by the cradle of the
little boy who died, the cold hands of the
valiant, betrayed Uriah must often have pushed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
them asunder, and a dark shadow born of their
guilty hearts must have passed between them
and the child. Perhaps when the feast was the
gayest a battle field rose before them, and when
the music was the loudest and the sweetest,
thrilling through it, they heard a dying moan.</p>

<p>When Joab wanted to reconcile David to
Absalom, he wished a mediator with wit, tact
and delicacy; with the eloquence of an orator
and the subtle flattery of a Decius Brutus, and
whom did he choose? A man? No: He sent
for "a wise woman," and we read that he
instructed her what to do, but judging from
other women we are sure she instructed him&mdash;anyway
she went to the King, and she talked
like a lawyer, she plead with eloquence, she
confessed charmingly, and she flattered with
the cunning of her sex, saying, "for as an angel
of God, so is my Lord the King to discern good
and bad," and "my Lord is wise, according to
the wisdom of an angel of God," which you will
admit was putting it pretty strong. But then,
men who didn't work for their living in those
days were used to strong language&mdash;of praise.
Perhaps it is superfluous for me to add that
the "wise woman" accomplished her mission.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p><p>We are told in poetic language that David
"was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance,
and goodly to look to," and perhaps that
was the chief reason (although women always
adored a man of valor, intelligence and strength)
that "Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David,"
and thus gave him the proud distinction of
being the first man who was ever loved by a
woman&mdash;at least the first one we have any
authentic, official record of.</p>

<p>Once upon a time David had prepared to
wipe Nabal, who was a very rich man, and his
followers, from the very face of the earth,
because a young man "told Abigail, Nabal's
wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out
of the wilderness, to salute our master, and he
railed on them."</p>

<p>Nabal was a churlish miser and little to be
trusted, and it seems Abigail, who "was a
woman of good understanding and of a beautiful
countenance," had heard nothing of this
little affair, but she was equal to the emergency
and she at once prepared many presents of
wine, and figs, and raisins and other good
things, and made haste to go out and meet
David, and if possible avert the impending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
calamity. "And she said unto her servants, Go
on before me; behold I come after you. But
she told not her husband," which shows conclusively
that although he was "churlish and evil in
his doings" she was not under his dominion to
any great extent, or afraid of his anger, for she
took things in her own hands and ran the government
to suit herself, for the time being at least.</p>

<p>So she met David, made a telling speech,
pleaded eloquently, flattered skillfully, and
David, who never could withstand the beauty
and oratory of another man's wife, granted her
every request, as he himself confessed and said
(I notice David always got particularly pious
when he was going to do or had done anything
particularly mean) to Abigail:</p>

<p>"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel which
sent thee this day to meet me: and blessed be
thy advice."</p>

<p>I don't know what kind of a bargain they
had made, but it sounds a little queer to hear
him saying to her, "go up in peace to thine
house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice and
have accepted thy person."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p><p>Abigail returned home and found her husband
had been having a gay time while she was
away, and "his heart was merry within him, for
he was very drunken," so she waited till the
morning "when the wine had gone out of Nabal,"
as it is quaintly put, and then she "told him
these things," but as there was nothing but good
news in "these things" she must have told him
something else that is not recorded, for "his
heart died within him, and he became as stone."</p>

<p>Now, I wouldn't cast a suspicion on Abigail
for any consideration, but it does seem a little
strange that ten days after her memorable meeting
with the handsome and musical David, "the
Lord smote Nabal that he died."</p>

<p>"And David sent and communed with
Abigail, to take her to him to wife."</p>

<p>I simply mention this little romance to prove
that there was no evidence of obedience in
Abigail's conjugal relations.</p>

<p>And Naomi, weary of the land of Moab, in
the shadows of whose mountains, guarded by
the angel of eternal sleep, lay the graves of her
husband and sons, longed in her loneliness for
the friends and associations of her youth. Her
heart turned back to the old house at home,
where there is always more sunshine and starshine,
softer breezes and sweeter bird-songs,
more silvery streams and fragrant flowers, than
in any other clime, and she was about to take
her departure for the "land of Judah."</p>

<p>Now it seems that Naomi was a very loveable
elderly lady, since her daughter-in-law
seemed to like her very much, though I haven't
the slightest idea that Ruth was really so
madly in love with her as we have been taught
to believe.</p>

<p>It appears that back in the "land of Judah,"
Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, "a
mighty man of wealth of the family of Elimelech;
and his name was Boaz."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p><p>You know it is true that when we go to live
in a strange country, we tell our new acquaintances,
incidentally and casually, perhaps, but
we tell them just the same, about our wealthy
and famous relatives, while the names of those
who were hanged because they may have loved
horse flesh "not wisely but too well," were arrested
for gambling, eloped with some other
woman's husband, or made garden on shares
for the neighbors, are kept locked in our hearts
as too sacred to mention to curious ears. Of
course Naomi was no exception, and so Ruth
had often listened, spellbound, to Naomi's description
of this "mighty man of wealth;" of
his fields undulating in golden waves, far and
near; of the springs that gushed and sparkled
and flowed down the hillsides; of the shining
streams idly wandering in his verdant valleys,
whose blue waves rose to caress the flowers on
the bank that dipped to be kissed; of his costly
array, his men servants and maid servants and
all the show and grandeur that was his.</p>

<p>So Ruth went down to the river one day
and gazed at her own reflection in the liquid
depths, took an honest inventory of her charms,
and the pride and confidence of the embryo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
conqueror thrilled her veins, the rose hue of
triumph dyed her dark cheek, and knowing that
Boaz was, according to the law of the Jews, her
future husband&mdash;if she could please him&mdash;she
went back and said to Naomi with the inherent
eloquence of a brilliant widow bent on conquest:</p>

<p>"Entreat me not to leave thee, or return
from following after thee; for whither thou
goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will
lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy
God my God:</p>

<p>"Where thou diest, will I die, and there will
I be buried. The Lord do so to me, and more
also, if aught but death part thee and me."</p>

<p>And Naomi, the dear old lady, was very
much flattered and had perfect confidence in
her daughter-in-law's professions, and so do we
also believe her words&mdash;that is, moderately.</p>

<p>When she says, "thy people shall be <i>my</i>
people," we believe she meant it&mdash;as far as Boaz
was concerned at least; but when she adds "thy
God shall be my God"&mdash;well, we have known
many people who were quite pious when they
were about to do something they wished to
cover up, and their prayers were a little more
fervent at that time, just to throw people off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the track, so to speak. And Ruth had decided
to capture Boaz's heart with her midnight eyes,
wear his gems upon her breast, and plunge both
hands deep down in his golden shekels. But
of course she didn't intend to confide this
dead secret to a garrulous old lady, and have it
reach the ears of the mighty man of wealth
perhaps, for the cunning, witty, pretty widow
knew that a man never likes to be caught.</p>

<p>So one day she (with Naomi) arrived at
Bethlehem with a half a dozen things in her
favor, any one of which would have made her
noted, at least.</p>

<p>She had youth (she was not more than
twenty-eight perhaps) the divine gift of beauty,
the luck of being a stranger, the advantage of
being a widow, the prestige of a convert, and
the novel notoriety of being the first woman in
the world who ever was in love with her mother-in-law.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder "that all the city was moved
about them?"</p>

<p>Well, no doubt Ruth found out all she wanted
to know about Boaz, learned his habits and
characteristics, made all the inquiries she wished
in a way that "was childlike and bland," and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
last having her arsenal well armored with the
big guns of wit and beauty and garrisoned by
facts and observations and the experience of an
ex-wife, she was ready for Love's war, where
the bullets are soft glances, the sword thrusts
kisses and the dungeon of the captive is the
bridal chamber, and she went to her mamma-in-law
and said sweetly, "let me go now to the
field and glean ears of corn after him (you see
she admitted she was after him) in whose sight
I shall find grace."</p>

<p>"And she went, and came, and gleaned in
the field after the reapers; and her hap was to
light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz."
Wonderful, wasn't it, that it was her "hap" to
light on a part of the field belonging to Boaz?</p>

<p>And lo, in the morning ere the sun was half
way up the blue sky, Boaz came into the barley
field and his eyes fell upon the beauteous Ruth
gleaning with the reapers, and delighted at the
sight, he called the general manager and said:</p>

<p>"Whose damsel is this?" And he answered
and said: "It is the Moabitish maiden that
came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>
<p class="figleft" style="width: 383px;">
<a name="Turned_her_pretty_head_aside_and_blushed" id="Turned_her_pretty_head_aside_and_blushed"></a>
<img src="images/image170.jpg" width="383" height="650" alt="(Turned her pretty head aside and blushed.)" title="Turned her pretty head aside and blushed" />
</p>

<p>It seems Boaz had never seen her before,
although her fame had reached his ears, and he
spoke to her softly and
kindly, praised her for
her devotion to her
mother-in-law (you
see that captured
his fancy and admiration, as it
has every one's since), and then
she smiled and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
thanked him very ardently, and then the wily
widow turned her pretty head aside and blushed.
And Boaz, who had never heard the advice to
"beware of the vidders," was taken in and done
for in that one short interview. He hung
around the fields, deserted the city, cared
naught for its pleasures, forgot the dames of
high degree, and lingered for hours among the
reapers to catch a glance from her dark eye, or
a smile from her ruby lips, and I suppose they
sometimes rested in the shade and talked sweet
nonsense, or sat in the intoxicating silence
when love speaks unutterable things to the
heart alone, and the "old sweet story was told
again" in the harvest field near Bethlehem.</p>

<p>"Boaz commanded his young men saying,
Let her glean even among the sheaves, and
reproach her not: And let fall also some of
the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them,
and rebuke her not."</p>

<p>Having alighted upon an easy task, Ruth
knew it. "So she kept fast by the maidens of
Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest
and of wheat harvest: and dwelt with her
mother-in-law."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p><p>And yet it seems the gentleman did not
propose. So Naomi and Ruth talked it over
together, for by this time his infatuation was
the talk of the city, and sentimental, romantic
old Naomi, who must have been a charming
woman in her day, was interested in this love
affair. For no matter how old a woman or man
may be, the perennial stream of love and sentiment
flows on in the heart, although hid 'neath
white hairs and wrinkles, and bound by the
wintry shackles of age and custom; still it is
there, and often breaks the icy barriers of the
years and betrays itself by a late marriage, or
in the matchmaking proclivities of all elderly women.</p>

<p>And Naomi gave Ruth some instructions
which we blush to think of, but she followed
them implicitly. And the middle-aged Boaz
was caught. We suppose he was forty-five or
fifty from the fact that he called Ruth "my
daughter," and commended her because she
didn't run after the gilded youths of society, but
preferred him above them all. And Boaz and
Ruth were married, and like most marriages
between widows and old bachelors it proved a
happy one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p><p>But Ruth's shrewd scheming and successful
venture as related in the inspired records confirms
our belief that it was Boaz the "mighty
man of wealth," and not Naomi's love or
Naomi's God that induced Ruth to emigrate to
the city of Bethlehem.</p>

<img src="images/image173.jpg" width="550" height="316" alt="(And Boaz and Ruth were married.)" title="And Boaz and Ruth were married." />
</p>

<p>We are told that Jezebel, unknown to her
husband, "wrote letters in her husband's name
and sealed them with his seals," and had a man
stoned to death without his knowledge, not the
man's, but her husband's.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p><p>That doesn't look as if she were ruled over
much, does it?</p>

<p>The sacred history says, speaking of Hagar
and Ishmael, "and his mother took him a wife
out of Egypt" which means that she selected
the girl and told him to marry her&mdash;and he
obeyed. And we find that Solomon gave to
the queen of Sheba "whatsoever she asked,"
which is an example of generosity we would
recommend to the men of to-day.</p>

<p>I had reached this point in my study of the
Bible, when one evening, just as I had seated
myself to begin work and was idly sharpening
my pencil, the door bell rang.</p>

<p>I had not seen my lover for weeks; not since
he had so sarcastically advised me to peruse
the Scriptures. I had waited for his coming,
but in vain; the mail brought no letter; he sent
no word by friend or foe. And I made no sign.
His had been the fault and his should be the
reparation, and so a profound silence fell like a
pall between us.</p>

<p>But love, the god of gods, strung the invisible
wires of mental telegraphy between our
hearts, and over the mystic, unseen lines our
thoughts, bright as hope, dark as sin, lighter
than the thistle down, heavily charged with the
electricity of doubt and trust, faith and fear,
love and longing, flew noiselessly back and forth
through the stillness and drew us unconsciously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
together; and so it happened that he stood upon
the doorstep and pulled the bell.</p>

<p>There was always a triumphant peal to his
ring that seemed to say to my heart, "Lo, the
conquering hero comes." And now that vital
organ bounded gladly in my breast, then stood
still; my pulses throbbed with delight and
triumph. Ten minutes before I would have
thrown the world away, if it had been mine, for
one smile from his lips, but now&mdash;I seized my
pencil and wrote rapidly on the tablet on my
knee as he entered the hall, came into the room,
and stood beside me, then with a little start I
looked up and exclaimed in feigned surprise:</p>

<p>"You here?"</p>

<p>"I think I am," he said, "but if you want
me to, I'll look in the mirror to make sure."
And then we both laughed, for 'tis so easy to
laugh when one is happy and all the world is gay.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, sitting down beside me,
clasping my hand in his as lovers sometimes do,
and taking up the conversation where it had
been dropped weeks and weeks before, "they
say you can buy a good cooking stove for forty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
dollars&mdash;and I've had my salary raised ten dollars a month."</p>

<p>Then I smiled and he said abruptly:</p>

<p>"When are you going to marry me?"</p>

<p>"I haven't completed my study of the Bible
yet, and I don't think I could be submissive, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, fiddlesticks!" he exclaimed, impolitely
interrupting me, "I don't want you to be submissive;
I just want you to love me and&mdash;and&mdash;boss
me," he added, in the very depth of repentance.</p>

<p>"But you demanded obedience," I insisted.</p>

<p>"I was foolish then," he said softly, "but
absence from you and silence has taught me
wisdom. When I left you and you made no
sign, sent no word of recall, left the dread quiet
unbroken, I told myself that you cared nothing
for me, and I tried desperately to fall in love
with some other girl, but they were all 'flat,
stale and unprofitable' compared to you. There
was no light in their eyes, no roses on their
cheeks, no pleasure in their presence, no rapture
in their touch&mdash;and&mdash;Oh, hang it! you
know I can't talk, but I love you, and as long as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
cooking stoves and marriage licenses are so
cheap and ministers are so plenty what's the
matter with having a wedding to-morrow?"</p>

<p>And I said&mdash;but never mind what I said.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
